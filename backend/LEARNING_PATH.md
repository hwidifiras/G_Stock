## 📞 Getting Help

### When You're Stuck:
1. Check the implementation guide for your current phase
2. Review error messages carefully - they often contain the solution
3. Use MongoDB Compass to inspect your data structure
4. Test API endpoints with Postman or curl
5. Ask specific questions about concepts you don't understand

### Best Practices:
- Complete each phase fully before moving to the next
- Take time to understand concepts, not just copy code
- Experiment with the code - try breaking things to understand how they work
- Test everything thoroughly before moving forward
